# API-Challenge
API homework

*WeatherPy*

This challenge involves using a new library citipy that provides geocoordinates for available cities
with population over 500

* [Technologies](#technologies)
* [Code Examples](#codeexamples)

## General info
Utilized the open weather api to get weather data for random cities list generated using citipy library.

## Technologies
* jupyter notebook - version 6.0.3

## Code Examples

`Data Cleaning:

1.created a cities list to hold a random city & tested it against query url for exception handling to identify a fake city.
2.appended(0) to the list for values returned by fake cities. cleaned the dataframe by retaining the rows that have non-zero values.
3.saved the file as csv.

 Data Plotting:
 
 1.plotted scatter plots using the dataframe that was created from the csv file.
 2.saved the figures as .png files.
 
 Linear Regression:
 
1.created two new dataframes for northern and southern hemisphere lat values.
2.plotted the linear regression lines & entered correlations based on the findings.


*VacationPy*

This challenge involves using jupyter-gmaps & google places API to generate humidity heat maps & ideal vacation cities with marker layer.

## Table of contents

* [Technologies](#technologies)
* [Code Examples](#codeexamples)

## General info
Utilized the .csv file generated in WeatherPy assignment.

## Technologies
* jupyter notebook - version 6.0.3

## Code Examples

`Data Cleaning:
1.from main dataframe, created a new dataframe that has columns for Lat & Lon.

 Humidity Heat Map:
 1.used gmaps to generate the base map.
 2.passed the Lat and Lon columns as inputs to locations & humidity as weights.
 3.added a heat map layer & saved the figure as .png file.
 
 Weather Fitting Criteria:
 1.created new dataframe matching the ideal weather criteria.
 2.used google places api to search for nearby hotels.
 3.added markup layer to the humidity heat map showing the hotel markups.
 4.saved the figure as .png file.
